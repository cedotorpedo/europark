# EuroPark Ride Wait Time Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict waiting times for different amusement park rides at EuroPark. We plan to develop two distinct models to enhance the amusement park experience:

1. **Attendance Prediction Model**: A simple model to predict the weekly attendance at EuroPark.

2. **Wait Time Prediction Model**: Building upon the attendance data, this model predicts the wait times for individual rides within the park.

## Motivation

Predicting ride wait times can greatly improve the visitor experience at EuroPark. By having insights into expected wait times, park visitors can plan their day more efficiently, optimizing their time and enjoyment.

## Data Sources

We will utilize historical data from EuroPark, including attendance records, ride-specific information, and wait time data. These datasets will serve as the foundation for our predictive models.

## Models

### 1. Attendance Prediction Model

The primary goal of this model is to forecast the weekly attendance at EuroPark. We will explore various time-series forecasting techniques to provide insights into expected visitor numbers.

### 2. Wait Time Prediction Model

Building upon the attendance predictions, this model will estimate the wait times for individual rides within the park. By analyzing attendance patterns and ride-specific data, we aim to create accurate wait time predictions.

## Dependencies

To run this project and utilize the predictive models, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3.x
- Data processing libraries (e.g., Pandas, Polars)
- Machine learning libraries (e.g., Scikit-Learn, XGBoost)
- Streamlit for building the interactive dashboard

## Getting Started
